# ðŸŒŸ PSO Java Implementation for the Rosenbrock Problem ðŸŒŸ

This project is a Java implementation of the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm applied to the **Rosenbrock Problem**.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Rosenbrock Problem

The Rosenbrock function, often referred to as the "banana function," is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. Its global minimum is located at:

- **Minimum point:** (1, 1)
- **Minimum value:** 0

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective Function

The objective function is defined as:

\[ f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2 \]

Where:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = 100 \)

### ðŸ”’ Constraints

For this implementation, there are no specific constraints applied to the Rosenbrock function.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Particle Swarm Optimization** algorithm implemented in Java.
- **Dynamic evaluation** of the Rosenbrock function to find the optimal solution.
